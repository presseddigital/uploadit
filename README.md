#### `id` option

To drag elements from one list into another, both lists must have the same `group` value.
You can also define whether lists can give away, give and keep a copy (`clone`), and receive elements.

*   name: `String` — group name
*   pull: `true|false|'clone'|function` — ability to move from the list. `clone` — copy the item, rather than move.
*   put: `true|false|["foo", "bar"]|function` — whether elements can be added from other lists, or an array of group names from which elements can be taken.
*   revertClone: `boolean` — revert cloned element to initial position after moving to a another list.
